# EDA-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and extract meaningful insights before applying any machine learning models.
EDA is a critical step in the data science pipeline as it helps in:

->Understanding data structure
->Identifying missing values & outliers
->Discovering relationships between variables
