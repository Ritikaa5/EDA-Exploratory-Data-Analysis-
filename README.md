# EDA-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and extract meaningful insights before applying any machine learning models.
EDA is a critical step in the data science pipeline as it helps in:

->Understanding data structure
->Identifying missing values & outliers
->Discovering relationships between variables

# EDA Steps Performed
 1. Data Loading & Inspection
      Shape of dataset
      Data types
      Summary statistics

2.Data Cleaning
     Handling missing values
     Removing duplicates
     Correcting data types

3.Univariate Analysis
     Distribution of numerical features
     Frequency of categorical variables

4.Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis
     Correlation analysis
    Feature relationships
     Heatmaps & pair plots

5.Outlier Detection
     Boxplots
     IQR method / Z-score

6.Insights & Observations
     Key trends
     Important correlations
     Business / real-world implications
